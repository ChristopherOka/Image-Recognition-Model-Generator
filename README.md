# Image-Recognition-Model-Generator
What exactly does this project do?
1. The user enters 1 or more queries
2. A webscraper searches on Google Images and downloads all images under that query. We used Selenium and Chromium for this
3. The images are pre-processed to get them ready for input into a ML model
4. The images are sent into a TensorFlow image recognition model, and a model is trained based on the images
5. The model is complete, and trained on the inputted data!
